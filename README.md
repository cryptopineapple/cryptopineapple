### About Me
Experienced Software Engineer working in Artificial Intelligence. Good software development, analytical mindset, and advanced research skills are my strongsuits.
I'm looking to use my talents to bring the rigorous software design principles found at successful internet-based companies to Web3.

The technical gap for many Web3 developers is still high - for the ecosystem to mature, the technology must be strong and that requires a principled approach to designing, testing, and maintaining software products.
